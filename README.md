# Task-Tracker
https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker
Task tracker is a project used to track and manage your tasks. In this task, you will build a simple command line interface (CLI) to track what you need to do, what you have done, and what you are currently working on. This project will help you practice your programming skills, including working with the filesystem, handling user inputs, and building a simple CLI application.

This is my first project to learn programming in consistent form. Feel free to suggest ways to improve.
